# React Todo App

This is a simple todo app built with React, Tailwind CSS, useContext, and local storage. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. The state management is handled using the useContext hook, and the task data is stored in the browser's local storage, allowing for persistence even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Create new tasks with a title and description.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Filter tasks by completed or active status.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to build this app:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- useContext: A React hook for managing state without the need for Redux or other state management     libraries.
- Local Storage: A web API that allows data to be stored locally in the user's browser.
